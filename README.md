# Adaptive Gene Level Mutation 

In this repository You can find our code which impelments an adaptive Gene Level Mutation for genetic algorithm, descird in the paper:

*Adaptive Gene Level Mutation*
Jala Al-afandi and András Horváth

Submitted to:
The journal of Algorithms

### Prerequisites-Installing
To run our code You need to install Python and Pandas.

### Running our code
The repository has  many scripts implenting the TSP problem and the N-Queen problem using adaptive gene level mutation over three different algorithm, genetic algorithm (GA), simulated annealing (SA) and Variable neighborhood search (VNS).

### Results illustration
It depicts a comparison for the TSP problem between Locus mutation and traditional mutation with different sets of parameters. The center of each curve is the expected value while the range visualizes the standard deviation. All the experiments have been repeated 100 times and then averaged out

It depicts a comparison for the N-Queens problem between Locus mutation and traditional mutation with different sets of parameters. The center of the curve is the expected value while the range visualize the standard deviation. All the experiments have been repeated 50 times and then averaged out. We can notice that the number of hitting queens is escalating when we increase the number of queens.
